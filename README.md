## VT CS Clubs - Unified Event Platform
A full-stack web application designed to be the central hub for all computer science club events at Virginia Tech. <br>
This platform enables students in discovering events that align with their technical interests and career goals, while simplifying the process of event promotion and management for club leaders.

- Company/Sponsor Profiles: Links from sponsored events to dedicated pages with information about internship/new grad roles and application deadlines.

- Simple RSVP System: A straightforward way for students to register their attendance for an event.
